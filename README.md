# Analyzing Customer Churn in the Banking Sector
 BankChurners project

Customer churn represents a major challenge for banks, as retaining existing clients is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on identifying patterns and risk factors associated with customer churn using two real-world datasets from the financial sector:

- **BankChurners.csv** 
- **Churn_Modelling.csv** 

## Analysis Overview
The analysis includes visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, boxplots, swarm plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables like income category, credit limit, and inactivity. Both datasets are compared to highlight trends and identify at-risk customer groups.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior based on income, geography, and credit usage.
- Compare actual vs. predicted churn rates.
- Identify correlations between customer activity and churn risk.
- Develop visual dashboards to support strategic decision-making.

## Data Source
Kaggle datasets:
- BankChurners.csv
- Churn_Modelling.csv

## Installation
1. Download the project script and datasets from GitHub.
2. Required Python version: **3.11**
3. Required libraries:
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - numpy
   - tqdm
   - os
4. Open the script (e.g., in Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code or Spyder) and update file paths accordingly.

## Results
- Churn rate in BankChurners dataset: approx. **17%** (predicted)
- Churn rate in Churn_Modelling dataset: approx. **20%** (actual)
- Inactivity, low contact frequency, and high credit utilization are key churn factors.
- Visual dashboards and Excel reports were generated to summarize key insights.

## Report
The full description, methodology, and results are documented in the final report (PDF available in English).
